This project analyzes data from the Sakila database. 

Exploration
When exploring the data, I soon realized that the questions I had initially might need more data to be able to produce meaningful results. For example, analyzing the correlation between larger stores and a higher number of employees was not possible. There was only one active staff member in each store, and rental numbers were very similar across stores.

Analyzes
The highest revenue per month was recorded in July and August for both stores, suggesting that hiring additional staff during these months may be beneficial. Alternatively, increased advertising in May and June could help increase rentals.
